Custom Tag Importer
====

Custom Tag Importer[^1] scans track information from custom tags in your music files. That includes rating tags because a rating tag is basically just a custom tag for ratings.

I created this as a favour for a friend during a covid lockdown and uploaded it here in case anyone finds a use for it.<br>
I currently have no plans to add it to the main LMS repository as a supported plugin.
